Homework   1 – Due February   12th, Wednesday   11:50pmInstructions: All questions are from the textbook. Please submit over the Canvas website as a pdf   or   a   word   document.   Other   formats   such   as   .jpg,   .dvi,   .eps   will   not   be   accepted   as   it   makes   the   grading   difficult,   and   sometimes   impossible   in   the   blackboard   grading   system.   You   could   also   write your homework in hardcopy and   scan   it.   There   are   some   free   smart phone   applications   that   would   allow you   scan your homework   if   needed. Please   do   not   forget   to   define   decision   and   the   slack variables properly.   Explain   your work   in   detail   to   get   full   credit.   For   fairness   reasons,   late   homeworks   will   be   subject   to   a   penalty   of   5 points   per   hour   of   delay.   Please   make   sure   that   the format of   the   homework is correct,   because if   the submitted files cannot   be opened   by a   pdf   viewer,   we will not be able to accept resubmissions.1. (50 points) Universal Claims Processors processes insurance claims for large national insurance   companies. Most   claim   processing   is   done   by   a   large   pool   of   computer   operators,   some   of   whom are permanent and some of   whom are temporary. A permanent operator can process   16 claims per   day, whereas a temporary operator can process   12 per day, and on average the company processes   at least 450 claims   each day.   The   company   has   40   computer workstations.   A   permanent   operator   generates about 0.5   claim with   errors   each   day, whereas   a   temporary   operator   averages   about   1.4   defective   claims   per   day.   The   company   wants   to   limit   claims   with    errors   to   25   per   day.   A   permanent   operator   is   paid   $64   per   day,   and   a   temporary   operator   is   paid   $42   per   day.   The   company wants to determine the number of   permanent and temporary operators to hire in order to   minimize costs.
a. Formulate a linear programming model for this problem.
b.   Solve this model by using graphical analysis.
2. (50 points) A canning company produces two sizes of   cans—regular   and   large.代 写Operations Management (33:136:386:22-26) Spring 2025 Homework 1C/C++
代做程序编程语言   The   cans   are         produced in   10,000-can lots. The cans are processed through a   stamping   operation   and   a   coating   operation. The company has 30 days available for both   stamping   and   coating. A   lot   of   regular-   size cans requires 2 days to stamp and 4   days to   coat,   whereas   a   lot   of   large   cans   requires   4   days   to stamp and 2 days to coat. A lot   of   regular-size   cans   earns   $800 profit,   and   a   lot   of   large-size cans earns $900 profit. In order to fulfill its   obligations   under   a   shipping   contract,   the   company must produce at least nine lots. The company wants to determine the number   of   lots   to produce       of   each size can (   and )   in   order to maximize profit.
a. Formulate a linear programming model for this problem.
b.   Solve this model by using graphical analysis.3. (Bonus: 20 points) The Valley Wine Company produces two kinds of   wine—Valley Nectar    and Valley Red. The wines are produced from 64 tons of   grapes   the   company has   acquired   this   season. A   1,000-gallon batch of   Nectar requires 4 tons of   grapes, and a batch of   Red requires   8 tons. However, production is limited by the availability of   only 50 cubic   yards   of   storage   space for aging and   120 hours of   processing time. A batch of   each type of   wine requires   5   cubic yards of   storage space. The processing time for a batch of   Nectar is   15 hours,   and the processing   time   for a batch of   Red is 8 hours. Demand for   each type   of   wine   is   limited   to   seven batches.   The   profit for a batch of   Nectar is $9,000, and the profit   for   a batch   of   Red   is   $12,000.   The   company   wants to determine the number of 1,000-gallon batches of   Nectar and Red to produce in   order to maximize profit.
a. Formulate a linear programming model for this problem.
b.   Solve this model by using graphical analysis.
c. How much processing time will be left unused at the optimal   solution?
d. What would be the effect on the optimal solution of   increasing   the   available   storage space from   50 to   60   cubic yards?
4. (Bonus: 20 points). Excel problem “Julia’s Food Booth” from the book   on page   113.
